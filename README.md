CasperSuiteScripts
==================

A collection of scripts I have worked on to be used with the Casper Suite, and in some cases, which can be used with other Mac management tools.

###Current scripts
####**selectable-SoftwareUpdate.sh**<br>
- Requires the current beta release of cocoaDialog to be installed on the target Mac.
- Displays a checkbox dialog with available Software Updates to be installed.
- Provides feedback on installations as they run with a moving progress bar.

####**installLatestFlashPlayer-v1.sh**<br>
(This script has been replaced by a new all purpose script I will be publishing to this page soon.)

####**install_Latest_AdobeReader.sh**   (_New_)<br>
(This script has been replaced by a new all purpose script I will be publishing to this page soon.)
